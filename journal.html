      In this journal I am keeping track of my journey to learn to code and

        I am starting this project June 20th, 2020. I have been coding for about
        a year now and I love it. I teach first grade now and in the beginning
        of 2019 I build my own arcade using a raspberry pi. I was showing my
        students one Friday before they went home, and one of them said I should
        make my own video game so I can put <strong>my own</strong>game on the
        arcade <strong>I</strong> built. After I suggested to his parents he
        immediately be moved to the 10th grade for having such amazing ideas, I
        went home and looked up "how to learn to code". I found a few different
        sites that caught my interest, but I really liked
        <a href="codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a>. I was hooked. All summer I
        set aside "work time" so I could develop my skills. I worked through
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS for the front end and I completed a
        few backend projects.

        The librarian at our school approached me one day with some coding
        questions. She also let me know she was expected to learn how to code
        and to be able to teach the students. Knowing she was uncomfortable with
        this expectation and having a passion for coding, I asked if I could
        help in any way. We developed a plan our principal approved for me to
        continue teaching my first grade class with the exception of writing. I
        would teach coding during that time and our librarian would teach my
        class writing. I was ecstatic! In order to be certified though I would
        have to take classes. I enrolled at Sheridan County Community College
        (the only college program our state teaching board approved of at the
        time) and started with a class based in HTML/CSS and another based in
        JavaScript. I successfully completed both and decided Front End (with an
        interest in learning more Back End work) Development was for me.

        I am now putting together a portfolio I hope to leverage into a job.
        These are the beginning steps of that goal and I look forward to
        learning more as I work on this project. I read somewhere that the goal
        should be to make a site where you already know 80% of what is required
        and learn the other 20%. I am aiming for a 70/30 split. I am hard coding
        the first few journal entries, but I plan on not needing to hard code
        all of them. I also want to leave areas for comments if anyone should
        stumble onto my page. I will start by utilizing my HTML/CSS/JavaScript
        skills, and I will create a page or two to show my ReactJS skills as
        well. I feel strong with HTML/CSS/JavaScript but my ReactJS skills need
        some development. I will start with a strong foot forward and go from
        there. I hope you have enjoyed reading.

        After a long production weekend, I am back at it. My goal today is to
        add some style to the navigation section of my page. I want the links to
        be aligned in a horizontal orientation, not a vertical. I want them to
        look like independent buttons that have some animation when hovered
        over. I have picked out a color scheme with 5 colors. I'm not sure if
        this is too many or not yet as this is my first site made from scratch.
        My plan is to use 2-3 colors as "main" colors and the other 2 as
        accents, sparingly here and there. I already have two fonts, one for my
        name "logo" and the other for the journal. I will select one more for
        the main text content of my site and call it good. I think the journal
        page will be the only page that would have all 3 and I want to keep it
        that way. If I can get the navigation to look the way I want it to, then
        I will start working on the journal so I don't have to hard code every
        entry. Wish me luck!
