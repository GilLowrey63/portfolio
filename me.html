      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Right now I teach first grade at a small charter school and I love it.
        the students are a lot of fun and I enjoy learning from my principal and
        fellow coworkers. When I am not teaching or coding i love hanging out
        with my wife and our two awesome bulldogs, Groot and Penny. Penny is the
        skateboarding dog and it is her absolute passion. She has been skating
        for close to 7 years now and it never stops amazing me. People ask if we
        are trying to teach Groot to skate, but he prefers to lend himself to a
        more sedimentary lifestyle and we respect that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we aren't with our dogs, my wife and I love going to movies and
        playing different sports. I have been playing hockey since I was 16 and
        my wife started playing a couple of years ago. It is a lot of fun
        getting to play with her and she's getting pretty good. My wife has been
        playing volleyball and basketball since she was in middle school. Since
        she played hockey, I tried both volleyball and basketball (I grew up in
        a small Wyoming town with no concrete so I had never played either
        before), and didn't too horribly. It is safe to say she is a better
        hockey player than I will ever be at basketball or volleyball.
      </p>

        We enjoy our time together very much and love to dream about the future.
        We hope to have kids one day and we hope to eventually have a cabin in
        the woods. We also dream of traveling around not only the country, but
        hopefully the world. If we can't find the time or means though, we are
        happy to take our little camper up to the mountains, or make a fort in
        the living room with our dogs. Either way, life is good and it's easy to
        smile.
